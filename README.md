# 📊 Telco-Chinese-Company-Loan-Approval-Case-Study-ML-Project

### 👨‍💻 **Project Overview:**
Today, I built a new project - **Telco-Chinese-Company-Loan-Approval-Case-Study-ML-Project**. This machine learning project uses Python and its powerful libraries to predict loan approval based on different features. I applied techniques like **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** to clean, analyze, and build a robust machine learning model. 
Solving this case study will give you an idea about how real business 
problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the 
techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic 
understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and 
understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while 
lending to customers.
  
Business Understanding 
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending 
various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a 
loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval 
based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the 
bank’s decision:
• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the 
loan results in a loss of business to the company
 • If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to 
default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the 
compan
